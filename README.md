# Workout Tracker

This is a demonstration of how functional programming techniques can improve Vaadin UI code. This is realized by implementing the application UI three times:

* [java7 branch](https://github.com/hezamu/WorkoutTracker/tree/java7) contains the starting point that utilizes Vaadin 7 and Java 7.
* [java8 branch](https://github.com/hezamu/WorkoutTracker/tree/java8) contains the an improved versio utilizing various improvements available in Java 8.
* [scala branch](https://github.com/hezamu/WorkoutTracker/tree/scala) is built in Scalu using the [Scaladin](https://github.com/henrikerola/scaladin) library. DAO layer remains Java 8.
